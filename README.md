### How it Works:

1. The necessary libraries, Trade and Timeseries, are included at the beginning of the code.
2. Input parameters such as the trading symbol, timeframe, risk percentage, and stop loss percentage are defined.
3. Global variables for the Trade and Timeseries class instances are initialized.
4. The OnInit() function is called during the initialization phase. It sets up trade parameters, including the expert magic number and maximum allowed deviation.
5. The trading symbol and timeframe are subscribed to using the Series.SetSymbol() function. If the subscription fails, an error message is printed.
6. The OnDeinit() function is called during the deinitialization phase to clean up resources.
7. The OnStart() function is the main trading logic. It gets the current bid price, calculates the trade volume based on the risk percentage, and calculates the stop loss level based on the stop loss percentage.
8. If a trading opportunity is identified (current bid price is higher than the stop loss level), a buy trade is opened using the Trade.Buy() function. The trade volume, symbol, stop loss level, and a comment are passed as parameters.
9. The result of the trade execution is checked using the Trade.ResultRetcode() function. If the trade is executed successfully, a success message is printed. Otherwise, an error message with the return code is printed.
10. If no trading opportunity is identified, a message is printed indicating that no trading opportunity was found.
